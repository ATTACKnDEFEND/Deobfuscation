## DEOBFUSCATION CHALLENGES

![alt text](https://github.com/ATTACKnDEFEND/Deobfuscation-Challenges/blob/main/image1.png)

This repository includes obfuscated files that are not harmful, but are modeled after actual malware. Its purpose is to provide a useful tool for security professionals and students to practice analyzing and deobfuscating malware using practical examples.

Challenges will have a solution provided shortly after initial release.

Please note that while all samples directly available within the challenges are benign, they will be archived with the password "infected," in line with industry standard. Additionally, this repository includes references to the original malware, which are outside the scope of this repository and not considered benign or non-malicious.

WARNING: LINKS TO POTENTIALLY MALICIOUS SAMPLES ARE PROVIDED AS A REFERENCE ONLY. THE CHALLENGES DO NOT REQUIRE DOWNLOADING THE ORIGINAL SAMPLES. It's important to exercise caution when working with malware samples, and to use appropriate security measures to prevent any accidental infection.
