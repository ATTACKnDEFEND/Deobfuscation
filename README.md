## DEOBFUSCATION CHALLENGES

Welcome to this repository, where you'll find non-malicious, obfuscated files based on real malware. It's a valuable resource designed to help security professionals and students practice analyzing and deobfuscating malware using practical examples. I regularly update the repository by reviewing samples from Malware Bazaar and other sources to provide fresh challenges.

Please note that while all samples directly available within the challenges are benign, they will be archived with the password "infected," in line with industry standards. Additionally, this repository will include references to the original malware, which are outside the scope of this repository and not considered benign or non-malicious.
