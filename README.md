## DEOBFUSCATION CHALLENGES

Welcome to this repository, where you'll find non-malicious, obfuscated files based on real malware. The resource is designed to help security professionals and students practice analyzing and deobfuscating malware using practical examples. I regularly update the repository by reviewing samples from Malware Bazaar and other sources to provide fresh challenges.

Challenges will have a solution provided shortly after initial release.

Please note that while all samples directly available within the challenges are benign, they will be archived with the password "infected," in line with industry standard. Additionally, this repository includes references to the original malware, which are outside the scope of this repository and not considered benign or non-malicious.

WARNING: LINKS TO POTENTIALLY MALICIOUS SAMPLES ARE PROVIDED AS A REFERENCE ONLY. THE CHALLENGES DO NOT REQUIRE DOWNLOADING THE ORIGINAL SAMPLES. It's important to exercise caution when working with malware samples, and to use appropriate security measures to prevent any accidental infection.
