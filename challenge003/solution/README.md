## CHALLENGE003 - CyberChef

1. Let's get started 

Open the VBScript file challenge002.vbs in CyberChef

2. Copy the code into the input field of CyberChef.

3. Use the "Variable substitution" recipe to replace the value of the "str" variable with its decoded value, which is "gsso9..@ss+bjmdcdmc-bnl".

4. Use the "ROT13" recipe to shift each character of the decoded string back by one. This will give you the original URL, which is "https://attackndefend.com".

5. Finally, you can see the deobfuscated code by looking at the output field of CyberChef.
